We can see that as expected, Greenwich passes LST = 0 at noon on the vernal equinox (~80 days into the year). Rephrased, this means that at noon on the vernal equinox, the local meridian at Greenwich is pointing in the direction of inertial :math:`\\hat{x}`, the first point of Aires, zero right ascension.
On the same date, the station in New Mexico is always facing 105 degrees earlier.

For example, on June 2nd (day 153 of the year), the LST at 12:00 UTC is approximately 21.67/24 * 360 = 325 degrees. For an observation at ~6:00 UTC, we subtract another 6/24*360 degrees to yield LST = 235 degrees.
