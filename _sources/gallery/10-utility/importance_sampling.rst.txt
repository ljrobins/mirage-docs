Importance Sampling
===================
Reducing the variance of Monte Carlo integration

Let's say we want to estimate the integral of an unknown function :math:`f(x)`

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 13-25

.. code-block:: Python

    x = sp.symbols("x")
    f_symbolic = sp.sin(np.pi * x)
    bounds = (0, 1)
    f = sp.lambdify(x, f_symbolic)
    xs = np.linspace(*bounds, 1000)

    plt.plot(xs, f(xs))
    plt.grid()
    plt.title("f(x)")
    plt.xlabel("x")
    plt.show()

We can analytically compute the integral of this function

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 27-30

.. code-block:: Python

    int_symbolic = sp.integrate(f_symbolic, (x, 0, 1))
    print(f"The analytic integral is {int_symbolic:.4f}")





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 .. code-block:: none

    The analytic integral is 0.6366




.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 31-32

A naive attempt at Monte Carlo integration would be to uniformly take samples of the function over the integral and average them

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 32-41

.. code-block:: Python

    n = 10  # number of samples
    f_of_x_naive = f(np.random.rand(n))
    int_naive = f_of_x_naive.sum() / n
    percent_error_naive = (int_naive - int_symbolic) / int_symbolic * 100

    print(
        f"The naive Monte Carlo integral is {int_naive:.4f}, {percent_error_naive:.2f}% error"
    )





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 .. code-block:: none

    The naive Monte Carlo integral is 0.7053, 10.79% error

The fundamental idea of importance sampling is that our Monte Carlo result will be better if we take samples from a distribution that looks like the true function, dividing each sample by its pdf likelihood. To accomplish this, let's select a pdf that might help

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 43-61

.. code-block:: Python


    from scipy.stats.sampling import TransformedDensityRejection


    class NewPdf:
        def pdf(self, x: float) -> float:
            # Note that this is slightly
            return -6 * x**2 + 6 * x

        def dpdf(self, x: float) -> float:
            return -12 * x + 6


    dist = NewPdf()
    pdf = TransformedDensityRejection(
        dist, random_state=np.random.default_rng(), domain=[0, 1]
    )

Let's try Monte Carlo integration again with the new pdf

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 63-72

.. code-block:: Python


    xs_sample = pdf.rvs(n)
    int_importance = (f(xs_sample) / dist.pdf(xs_sample)).sum() / n
    percent_error_importance = (int_importance - int_symbolic) / int_symbolic * 100

    print(
        f"The importance sampled integral is {int_importance:.4f}, {percent_error_importance:.2f}% error"
    )

    The importance sampled integral is 0.6305, -0.96% error

Let's take a look at the points we sampled
